# SimplePythonProjects
This is my first repository, for simple testing purposes, though it may be used as part of a portfolio at some point.

This is my first foray into the programming world. I am also attempting to understand how GitHub works, so there is no need to deeply read into any of this.

What you see here are a few simple projects that I put together in order to test out basic Python concepts. 

Some were created with the help of walk-throughs, and some were general ideas that I "trial and error"-d. The number guessing game, for example, among others.

I will be adding projects to this periodically, though not terribly often. I'll be experimenting along the way with IT / cybersecurity scripts, so that is likely what will make up the bulk of what people may consider "interesting" or "substantial."
