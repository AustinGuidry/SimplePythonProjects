# SimplePythonProjects
This is my first repository, for simple testing purposes.

This is my first foray into the programming world, specifically using Python. I am also attempting to understand how GitHub works, so there is no need to deeply read into any of this.

What you see here are a few simple projects that I put together in order to test out basic Python concepts. 

Most of them were created with the help of walk-throughs, aside from the number guessing game. The number guessing game was one that I wrote by myself with only a general aim in mind, rather than following steps.
